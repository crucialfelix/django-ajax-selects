    Subclass this, setting the model and implementing methods to taste.

        model (Model): The Django Model that this lookup channel will search for.
        plugin_options (dict): Options passed to jQuery UI plugin that are specific to this channel.
        min_length (int): Minimum number of characters user types before a search is initiated.

            This is passed to the jQuery plugin_options.
            It is used in jQuery's UI when filtering results from its own cache.

            It is also used in the django view to prevent expensive database queries.
            Large datasets can choke if they search too often with small queries.
            Better to demand at least 2 or 3 characters.
